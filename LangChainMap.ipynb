The occupation, through tightening the siege and preventing the entry of essential life supplies, targets the most vulnerable Palestinians, such as the sick, elderly, children, and those with special needs. These are the ones that Netanyahu seeks to kill as part of his new list of targets. Tightening the siege represents a complete genocide and a described war crime, pressing on the Arab, Islamic, and global conscience to act immediately to save more than two million people in Gaza. It is up to the United States to compel the occupation to implement the ceasefire agreement as signed, instead of expanding the circle of fire. Pressuring the occupation and preventing it from evading the requirements of the agreement is the only way to preserve the lives of the prisoners and ensure their return to their families.\n",
